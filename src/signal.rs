//! Signal handling via `rt_sigaction`, plus the x86_64 `SA_RESTORER`
//! trampoline.
//!
//! This mirrors glibc's BSD-style `signal(3)`: the handler is persistent
//! (not reset after delivery) and installed with `SA_RESTART`, so slow
//! syscalls resume rather than failing with `EINTR`. The delivered signal is
//! blocked for the duration of its own handler by the kernel default.
//!
//! ## The x86_64 restorer problem
//!
//! On x86_64 the kernel has **no** default signal-return path: when a handler
//! returns, control resumes at whatever address `sa_restorer` points to, and
//! that code must invoke `SYS_rt_sigreturn` to unwind the kernel-pushed signal
//! frame. glibc supplies this trampoline; since we do not link glibc's
//! `sigaction`, we must supply our own. `sigreturn_trampoline` is a naked
//! function doing exactly `mov rax, RT_SIGRETURN; syscall`, and every
//! [`signal`] install sets `SA_RESTORER` and points `sa_restorer` at it.
//!
//! aarch64 (Phase 5) needs no restorer: its kernel installs a default vDSO
//! trampoline, so `SA_RESTORER` is neither set nor required there.
